<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>APPLICANT AGREEMENT</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.1278in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I plan to apply for a postdoctoral 
dental position, to start between April 1 and December&nbsp;31, 2016, 
for the first year of training in one or more programs that participate 
in the Postdoctoral Dental Matching Program (the &#8220;Match&#8221;).  I agree to 
participate in and to abide by the policies of the Match.  Specifically,
 I agree:</p>

<p style="text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.173334in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To abide by the Schedule of Dates of 
the Match as shown on the Match web site (natmatch.com/dentres), 
which is incorporated by reference in and is an integral part of this 
Agreement.</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.172801in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.173334in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To provide complete and accurate information to programs to which I apply.</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.172801in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.173334in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not to make any commitments to or 
contracts with any participating program prior to the release of the 
Match results.  If I choose to accept a position at a program that is 
not participating in the Match, or decide not to participate in the 
Match for
any other reason, then I will submit a withdrawal from the Match and 
will NOT submit a Rank Order List for the Match.</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.172801in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.173334in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To accept appointment to the program 
with which I am matched.  The program will send a letter of confirmation
 of the Match result to me, which I must sign and return to the program 
within 30 days of the release of the Match results.</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.172801in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.173334in; text-indent: -0.243333in; margin-left: 0.243333in;">
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To pay a non-refundable, 
non-transferable applicant fee of $90.00 U.S. to register for the Match
 for positions beginning in 2016.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that I am free to make 
personal contacts with any participating program in which I am 
interested, and to apply to as many of these programs as I wish, and to 
rank them according to my judgement.  If I submit a Rank Order List for 
Phase I of the Match, I may rank only programs participating in Phase I 
of the Match on my Phase I Rank Order List.  If I am matched in Phase I,
 I understand that I will not be permitted to submit a Rank Order List 
for Phase II of the Match.  If I do not submit a Rank Order List for 
Phase I, or if I am not matched in Phase I, I may submit a Rank Order 
List for Phase II on which I may rank only programs participating in 
Phase II of the Match.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that I may freely discuss any matter with a program and that I and the program may express a high level of interest in each other. I may voluntarily inform a program as to whether or not I intend to rank the program, and a program may voluntarily inform me as to whether or not it intends to rank me. However, neither party (applicant or program) may solicit such information from the other party. In addition, neither party may disclose to the other party or solicit from the other party any information regarding the positioning of any program or applicant on a Rank Order List. Furthermore, any expression of interest made during the discussion between me and a program is subject to change based on further considerations.  <b>Both the program and I have the right to change our minds at any time prior to the submission of the Rank Order Lists.</b></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the purposes of the Match, my Rank 
Order List is to be the sole determinant of the order of preference 
among the programs to which I have applied.  Similarly, for the purposes
 of the Match, the Rank Order List submitted by each program is to be 
the sole determinant of the program's order of preference among the 
applicants to the program.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand and agree that information 
concerning my participation in the Match, including my Match result, may
 be provided to me electronically.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that the result I obtain in
 the Match, whether I am matched or not and to which program I have been
 matched, may be reported to my dental school, to programs participating
 in the Match, and to others, either by mail or electronically.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that my appointment to the 
program to which I am matched may be contingent on my satisfying 
eligibility requirements for appointment specified by the institution 
and program.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>I understand that the sponsoring 
organizations of the Postdoctoral Dental Matching Program possess 
beneficiary standing to enforce this Agreement, and violations of the 
terms of this Agreement will be reported to the appropriate sponsoring 
organizations.</b>  I understand that if I violate any of the terms of 
this Agreement, such as refusing to accept a position at a program to 
which I have been matched, the sponsoring organizations may pursue all 
available remedies, including reporting my actions to my dental school 
or to other Match participants.  Even if I receive a written release 
from the program, the sponsoring organizations may impose penalties on 
me, such as cancellation or denial of memberships in the sponsoring 
organizations, and barring me from participation in future Matches.</p>
