Please read these terms of service (customer) (these "Customer Terms") carefully as they form a contract between you and Shoot & Share, Inc. dba PASS ("PASS", "we", "us", or "our") that governs your access and purchase of photography or other products or services (hereinafter, collectively, the “Photography Products”) from pass.us, passpremier.com and shootandshare.com (collectively the "Site”).  Separate terms govern photographers and others using the Site for hosted photography sharing solutions and desktop, gallery and mobile applications, and are set forth at <a href="http://pass.us/policies/tos">Terms Of Service</a>.
By using any of the Site to purchase Photography Products (the “Product Services”) you agree to be bound by these Customer Terms. If you are using the Product Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Customer Terms for that organization and representing to PASS that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Customer Terms (in which event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate paid contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Product Services. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE CUSTOMER TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE PRODUCT SERVICES. Should you have any questions concerning these Customer Terms, please contact help@pass.us.
Please note that, as more fully set forth below, PASS doesn't provide warranties for the Product Services, and this contract also limits our liability to you.
