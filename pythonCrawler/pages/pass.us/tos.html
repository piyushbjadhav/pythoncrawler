Pass is a digital photo delivery mechanism and by using PASS to share photos you are agreeing that you own ALL REQUIRED LEGAL rights to the images you upload and are allowing others the right to download, share, print and create other products using the images that you have uploaded for THEIR personal and non-commercial use.
Please read these terms of service (these "Terms") carefully as they form a contract between you and Shoot & Share, Inc. dba PASS ("PASS", "we", "us", or "our") that governs your access and use of: (i) the hosted storage solution provided by PASS (the "Product") for online storage, sharing and processing of files, materials, data, text, audio, video, images or other content (collectively, "Content"); (ii) the PASS desktop application, gallery desktop application and mobile applications and any other software provided or made available by PASS (the "Software"); (iii) pass.us, passpremier.com and shootandshare.com (collectively the "Site"); and (iv) any written or electronic documentation provided or made available by PASS (the "Documentation") (collectively, the Product, the Software, any Content provided by PASS, and the Documentation are referred to herein as the "Services"). 
By using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and representing to PASS that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate paid contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Services. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES. Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact help@pass.us.
Please note that, as more fully set forth below, PASS doesn't provide warranties for the Services, and this contract also limits our liability to you. 
CHANGES TO THESE TERMS - We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time in our sole discretion. We will indicate at the top of these Terms the date these Terms were last updated. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms on the Site (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms). Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of these Terms whenever you visit the Site to see if these Terms have been updated. Your continued access or use of any portion of the Services after the effective date of any changes means you accept and agree to the changes. 
ACCESS TO THE SERVICES - You may use the Services, on a non-exclusive basis, solely in strict compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, and only if you have the power to form a contract with PASS and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so.
PHOTO UPLOADS – To properly use the Services, all photographs uploaded by Photographer must be free of watermarks, borders or photographer placed mark-ups, and a minimum of 4000 pixels on the long edge and 2666 pixels on the short edge.  Photographs that include watermarks, borders or photographer placed mark-ups, or that are less than this minimum number of pixels may not be properly displayed on the Site or properly developed into photography products.  Photographer takes full risk of loss and indemnifies and protects PASS from any claims arising from a violation of this standard as well as any and all matters involving the quality of photographs taken as further set forth below. Photographer is solely responsible for ensuring that all of Photographer’s images have sufficient resolution and have the correct settings to be developed into photography products. PASS and its print vendors are not responsible for any cost or losses resulting from incorrect resolution or other settings of the images.

USER CONTENT - Except for Content we provide, we don't claim ownership of any Content that is transmitted, stored, accessed, or processed in your account(s). We also don't control, verify, or endorse any Content that you and others make available on the Services. Content uploaded, expressed or submitted to the Services, other than any Content provided by PASS, is solely the responsibility of the person or entity submitting it and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of PASS. We are not responsible, or liable to you or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any Content posted by you or any other user of the Services. We provide functions that allow you to control who may access your Content. If you enable the features that allow you to share your Content with others, anyone you've shared content with (including the general public, in certain circumstances) may have access to your Content and may distribute it to others without your consent. You hereby grant PASS and its employees and contractors the right, to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, distribute, display and disclose Content you post on the Services solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services or as otherwise permitted by these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights in your Content necessary for you to use the Services and to grant the rights in this Section. You will: (a) be solely responsible for the nature, quality and accuracy of your Content; (b) must ensure that your Content (including the storage or transmission thereof) complies with these Terms and any and all applicable laws, and regulations; (c) promptly handle and resolve any notices and claims relating to your Content, including any notices sent to you or to PASS by any person claiming that any of your Content violates any person's rights, such as take-down notices pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and any other notices; and (d) maintain appropriate security, protection and backup copies of your Content. PASS will have no liability of any kind as a result of the deletion of, correction of, destruction of, damage to, loss of or failure to store or encrypt any of your Content. You must immediately notify PASS in writing of any unauthorized use of (a) any of your Content, (b) any account, or (c) the Services that comes to your attention. In the event of any such unauthorized use by any third party that obtained access through you, you will take all steps necessary to terminate such unauthorized use. You will provide PASS with such cooperation and assistance related to any such unauthorized use as PASS may reasonably request. 
LIMITS OF SERVICE - We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Services, or any portion thereof, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services are unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some or all Services to users. Disk space and bandwidth are not unlimited (see TERMS OF PAYMENT FOR SERVICES below). 
AGE REQUIREMENTS - You must be at least 18 to use the Services. 
DOMAIN NAMES - PASS reserves the right to revoke, deactivate, change or require you to change a Vanity URL for any reason, including but not limited to inappropriate URL names that do not represent who you are or the content of your galleries, a name that is the currently published business name and/or intellectual property right of another party, or any URL name that includes profanity or terms that could be interpreted to be derogatory in nature to a specific person or people group. PASS may exercise such right at any time, with or without prior notice.
TERMS OF PAYMENT FOR SERVICES - The Services are paid for on a ten (10) year per event hosting arrangement. PASS reserves the right to charge additional fees per event to, or terminate one or more event hosting arrangements of (i) users who elect to upload any single file larger than twenty megabytes, (ii) users who upload more than 20 gigabytes of disk space per event, (iii) users who use more than 100 gigabytes of bandwidth per month, or (iv) users that do not comply with these Terms or do not use the Services as contemplated by PASS (including but not limited to using the Services primarily for storage and not photography sharing), as determined in its sole discretion. The price stated for the Services excludes all taxes and charges, unless specifically stated otherwise. If payment is not received by PASS on the due date, your account will be frozen, inaccessible, and all shared links will be turned off until all outstanding payments have been processed by PASS. You retain the responsibility for settling all outstanding balances in a timely manner and maintaining updated billing information. If your account is past due for 90 days, your account will be deactivated and all files will no longer be retrievable. Except as specifically set forth in these Terms, all Services are prepaid for the ten year hosting term and are non-refundable. Except as prohibited by law, we may assess a late charge if you do not pay on time. You must pay these late charges when we bill you for them. The late charge will be the lesser of 1 percent of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate permitted by law. We may use a third party to collect past due amounts. You must pay for all reasonable costs we incur to collect any past due amounts, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs. We may suspend or cancel your access to the Services if you fail to pay in full on time. 
PRODUCT PURCHASES – The terms of service governing the purchase of products using photographer’s photos and sold on the Site are set forth in the <a href="http://pass.us/policies/sale">Terms Of Sale</a>.
PHOTO PRICE SETTING BY PHOTOGRAPHER – PASS may allow photographer users to set the pricing of certain products that are produced from the Photographer’s photos and sold on the Site (“Photographer Set Pricing”). In the event that Photographer Set Pricing is allowed, Photographer may earn credits as further agreed upon by PASS.
IF any products (digital, physical or otherwise) are offered through your gallery, you agree to the following PASS terms of sale and return/exchange policy:  In the event of a photography product or products being returned due to Photographer’s noncompliance with these Terms, Photographer shall pay the cost of the product(s), the appropriate PASS transaction fee and all credit card processing fees associated with the product(s) or order at a rate of 2.9% per order total, plus $0.30 per transaction.  You are fully responsible for dealing with any customer disputes, cancellations/refunds and exchanges of orders relating to your non-compliance with these Terms.
PHOTOGRAPHER CREDITS - PASS may offer photographer users the ability to earn credits when products using the photographer's photos are sold on the Site. The number of credits to be earned shall be based upon the difference between the price paid by customers for certain products and the cost of those products, including any applicable fees associated with the order of those products (such as, but not limited to, shipping, handling, and credit card processing). The number of credits earned for product sales will be subject to change at any time.  You may only earn credits via PASS's authorized product sale mechanisms. Once earned, credits can be redeemed for Services or, in limited circumstances, can be redeemed for cash. You understand that credits are not transferable, may not be auctioned, bartered or sold, may not be pooled with other users, and subject to the limitations set forth below, expire 5 years after issuance. 
PASS reserves the right to void credits earned if we suspect that the credits were earned in a fraudulent manner, in a manner that violates these Terms, or in a manner otherwise not intended by PASS.   Additionally, if a product is not paid for by a customer or there is a return or refund of payment made by a customer due to a Photographer’s noncompliance with these Terms, including but not limited to Terms regarding uploading standards,  credits earned may be voided.  
Any credits in your account will be automatically applied by PASS (redeemed to cover) any required payments for Services as they become due. You will also have the option to redeem your credits fin lieu of payment for new Services. If you owe PASS an amount exceeding your credits, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered with your account to cover the amount owed. Your failure to pay fully any amounts owed to PASS on demand will be a violation of these Terms, and you will be liable not only for the amount collected but also for PASS's costs associated with collection, including without limitation attorney fees, court costs, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.
We will alternatively redeem your credits for cash according to the following rules: 
PASS will redeem your credits for cash (via electronic payment or check) only upon your request for a cash redemption, which may take up to thirty (30) days for us to process.
We can redeem your credits for cash only if we have your current mailing address and any other information we need to make the redemption on record, including, if required, identification and tax and business formation documentation, such as a Form W-9.
Credits will be redeemed only in United States Dollars whether being paid in cash or used in lieu of  payments on your account.
No cash redemption for accumulated credits will be made if it would be less than Fifty United States Dollars ($50.00), unless your account is being deactivated or deleted.
We may delay payout related to any investigation we are conducting regarding the appropriateness of credits issued or any other matter, but in no case longer than 180 days after the transaction.
Credits can only be redeemed for cash within one (1) year from their date of issuance.  
We may deduct from payout any amounts for which you are past due to PASS on any payment in connection with any PASS Service.
You are responsible for any tax liabilities arising from any redemption of cash made to you by PASS.  

You must provide written notification of any disputed redemption of cash within 30 days of receipt of the associated redemption.  Failure to do so constitutes a waiver by you of any claim relating to the redemption.
The credit program is void where prohibited by law. PASS reserves the right to modify or terminate the credit program at any time, although credits accrued shall be valid for one year from the date of any such termination. Should there be any tax liability for the accumulation and/or use of credits, such taxes are the sole responsibility of the participant. 
If PASS makes a redemption of cash to you in error, you are liable for the full amount of that redemption. You agree to reverse the redemption of cash or to permit PASS to reverse the redemption. You must provide written notification of any disputed redemption of cash within 30 days of receipt of the associated payment. Failure to do so constitutes a waiver by you of any claim relating to the payout.
If we are unable to pay you because you have not provided valid payment information or, where required, valid identification information, we may terminate your credits to the extent permissible by law, and process any remaining credits in accordance with applicable law.
PASS is not a bank and does not offer banking services. You will not earn interest on your credits. Credits are not deposit obligations and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, or any other entity or insurance scheme, whether governmental or private. All credits are held and expressed in United States Dollars; if your transaction was in a different currency, proceeds from the sale will be converted at the time of the transaction according to the day's published exchange rate before being credited to your credits.
STATISTICS AND ANALYTICS - Statistics and Analytic data is updated nightly. The Services use third-party data to derive visitors' geographic locations from their IP address. Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee any specific accuracy level.
CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND SOLICITATION - By registering with PASS, you understand that we may send you communications or data regarding the Services, including but not limited to (a) notices about your use of the Services, including any notices concerning violations of use, (b) updates, and (c) promotional information and materials regarding PASS's products and services, via electronic mail.
