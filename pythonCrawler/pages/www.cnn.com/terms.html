You must send any such notice to CNN by email to copyrightagent@turner.com AND by U.S. Mail to Copyright Agent, Legal Department, 1 CNN Center, Atlanta, GA 30303-2762.  To the extent that CNN has your contact information, it will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail, or otherwise to your email address.  CNN and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent.  CNN and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations.  After 30 days, CNN or you may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30 day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Sites. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between CNN and you arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the state in which you reside. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration.  </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in New York, New York, and CNN and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in New York, New York to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at "<a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>," or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">CNN shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous.  You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless CNN is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.  The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on CNN and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  CNN and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney's fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CNN and you agree not to seek any attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose.  CNN and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, CNN and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. CNN and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">If your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">You may choose to pursue your claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over CNN and you otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where your claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by these arbitration provisions by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following Email address copyrightagent@turner.com AND by U.S. Mail to Copyright Agent, Legal Department, 1 CNN Center, Atlanta, GA 30303-2762.  The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Site or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on the Site, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate any disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, CNN also will not be bound by them.  If you do not affirmatively elect to opt out as described above, your use of the Site will be deemed to be your irrevocable acceptance of these Terms of Use and any changes/updates to this section or otherwise.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect. In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, CNN and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of CNN to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>12. Class Action Waiver.</strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY -- IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">CNN and you agree that CNN and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims brought under these Terms of Use in connection with the Site will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  CNN and you further agree that CNN and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with the Site. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New York, New York. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any parent or affiliated company of CNN to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>13.

The enforceable sections of these Terms of Use will remain binding upon the parties.  The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Neither CNN nor you shall be liable for damages or for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts or occurrences beyond their reasonable control, including, without limitation: fire, lightning, explosion, power surge or failure, water, acts of God, war, terrorism, revolution, civil commotion or acts of civil or military authorities or public enemies: any law, order, regulation, ordinance, or requirement of any government or legal body or any representative of any such government or legal body; or labor unrest, including without limitation, strikes, slowdowns, picketing, or boycotts; inability to secure raw materials, transportation facilities, fuel or energy shortages, or acts or omissions of other common carriers.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>14.
